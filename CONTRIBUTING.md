# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project!

## Important Notice

**This project does not accept external code contributions.** All pull requests will be closed without being merged.

> If a pull request feels like the best way to illustrate a point or demonstrate a proposed change, feel free to open one — it will be read and discussed like an issue, but will not be accepted.

## How You Can Help

While pull requests are not accepted, your feedback is still valuable. You can contribute by opening issues for:

- **Bug reports** — Help identify and fix problems.
- **Feature requests** — Share ideas for improvements.
- **Questions or discussions** — Ask about usage or suggest enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, version, etc.)
- Relevant logs or screenshots if applicable

## Suggesting Features

Please describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution or idea
- Any alternatives you've considered

## Why No Pull Requests?

This is a personal project with a specific vision and architecture. Maintaining external contributions would require significant time and effort better invested in development.

Your understanding is genuinely appreciated.
